# Gumpify

This is a theme for [pelican](blog.getpelican.org). It's designed to be a very simple theme focus on the content. It uses some CSS transition to give a smooth experience. You can see an example on [my personal blog](http://www.malexandre.fr).

## Installation

Clone this repository in your computer. In your `pelicanconf.py`, set the path in the `THEME` value. Use the `dist` folder.

For example, if I download the theme in the folder `/home/marc/git/gumpify`, I'll need to configure my theme like this:
```
THEME = '/home/marc/git/gumpify/dist'
```
